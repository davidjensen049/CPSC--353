Project name: PA01-CR Sentiment Analysis

Code Reviewer: Alfonso Castanos

On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of __1__ based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile

2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors

3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically:

4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines (e.g. it contains extraneous code from the example program that has not been removed) or is insufficiently documented.
Specifically:

5  The program produces correct output and is well written and complies with all the Chapman Computer Science Coding Standards

Suggestions for improving the code:
Fix the syntax error on line 32 So the program can compile. That allows for 
the program to handle any error that may arise. The syntax error does not allow
you to run the program so I could not tell if your program worked. Also run your
program through the flake8 command to see the errors done in the coding 
language and fix them.
